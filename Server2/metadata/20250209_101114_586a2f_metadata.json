    "ai_analysis": "**Situational Analysis:**\nBased on the real-time data from the drone surveillance system, two humans have been detected in the scene. The audio transcription reveals a positive statement, \"Healthy!\", which suggests that the individuals are not in immediate distress. The absence of any danger or risk signals in the audio analysis data further supports this assessment. However, the lack of a scene description and key visual details limits our understanding of the environment and the individuals' specific situation.\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\nNo immediate risks have been identified based on the provided data. The danger detection and risk analysis both indicate a low-risk scenario, with no signs of distress or danger.\n\n**Actionable Steps for Rescue Teams:**\nGiven the limited information, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Gather more visual information**: Attempt to gather a scene description and key visual details to better understand the environment and the individuals' situation.\n2. **Monitor audio feed**: Continue to monitor the audio feed for any changes in the individuals' tone, language, or behavior that may indicate a shift in their situation.\n3. **Maintain surveillance**: Keep the drone in the area to maintain surveillance and be prepared to respond if the situation changes.\n4. **Prepare for potential deployment**: While there are no immediate risks, it's essential to be prepared to deploy rescue teams if the situation escalates or new information becomes available.\n\nBy taking these steps, rescue teams can remain vigilant and be ready to respond if necessary, while also gathering more information to inform their decision-making.",
