    "ai_analysis": "**Situational Analysis:**\nBased on the provided real-time data from the drone surveillance system, one human has been detected in the scene. However, due to the lack of a scene description and key visual details, the context and environment of the detected individual are unknown. The audio analysis data is also incomplete, with an error occurring during the transcription and risk analysis process.\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\nThere are no immediate risks detected based on the available data, as the \"Danger Detected\" flag is set to False. However, the error in the audio analysis data may indicate a potential issue with the system's ability to assess the situation accurately.\n\n**Actionable Steps for Rescue Teams:**\nGiven the limited information, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Re-deploy the drone** to gather more visual data and provide a scene description to better understand the context of the detected individual.\n2. **Verify the audio analysis system** to resolve the error and ensure that it can process media files correctly. This will help to gather more information about the situation and potential risks.\n3. **Send a reconnaissance team** to the location to gather more information about the individual and the environment, if possible.\n4. **Prepare for a potential rescue operation**, but wait for more information and a clearer understanding of the situation before taking action.\n5. **Review and analyze** the drone's surveillance footage to see if there are any other details that may have been missed, such as additional individuals or potential hazards.\n\nBy taking these steps, rescue teams can gather more information, assess the situation more accurately, and develop a more effective plan to respond to the detected individual's needs.",
