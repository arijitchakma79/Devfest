    "ai_analysis": "**Situational Analysis:**\nBased on the real-time data from the drone surveillance system, one human has been detected in the scene. However, due to the absence of a scene description and key visual details, the context and environment of the detected individual are unknown. The audio analysis data is also incomplete, with an error occurring during the transcription and risk analysis process.\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\nThere are no immediate risks detected based on the available data, as the \"Danger Detected\" flag is set to False. However, the error in the audio analysis data may indicate a potential issue with the system or the quality of the audio feed, which could impact the accuracy of the risk assessment.\n\n**Actionable Steps for Rescue Teams:**\nGiven the limited information available, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Re-deploy the drone** to gather more visual data and attempt to obtain a scene description and key visual details.\n2. **Verify the audio feed** to ensure it is a valid media file and re-run the audio analysis to obtain a more accurate risk assessment.\n3. **Send a reconnaissance team** to the location to gather more information about the scene and the individual detected, if possible.\n4. **Stand by for further instructions**, as more data becomes available, the rescue team can reassess the situation and develop a more informed plan of action.\n\nIt is essential to note that the current data is incomplete, and any rescue efforts should be approached with caution until more information is gathered.",
