    "ai_analysis": "**Situational Analysis:**\nBased on the real-time data from the drone surveillance system, two humans have been detected in the scene. However, the scene description and key visual details are not available, limiting our understanding of the environment and the individuals' circumstances. The audio analysis data is also incomplete due to an error, which prevents us from gathering more information about the situation.\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\nNo immediate dangers have been detected according to the audio analysis data. However, the lack of visual details and scene description, combined with the error in the audio analysis, introduces uncertainty and potential risks that cannot be fully assessed at this time.\n\n**Actionable Steps for Rescue Teams:**\nGiven the limited information, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Re-deploy the drone** to gather more visual data, if possible, to obtain a clearer understanding of the scene and the individuals' situation.\n2. **Investigate the audio analysis error** to resolve the issue and potentially gather valuable audio information that could aid in the rescue operation.\n3. **Prepare for a potential rescue operation**, considering the presence of two humans in the scene, and be ready to respond as soon as more information becomes available.\n4. **Consider alternative surveillance methods**, such as ground-based sensors or other aerial assets, to supplement the drone's data and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.\n5. **Maintain a state of readiness** and be prepared to adapt the response plan as more information becomes available, ensuring the safety of both the individuals in the scene and the rescue teams.",
