    "ai_analysis": "**Situational Analysis:**\nBased on the real-time data from the drone surveillance system, one human has been detected in the scene. However, the scene description and key visual details are not available, which limits our understanding of the situation. The audio analysis data is also incomplete due to an error, which prevents us from gathering more information about the environment and potential risks.\n\n**Immediate Risks:**\nNo immediate dangers have been detected according to the audio analysis data. However, the lack of visual details and incomplete audio analysis data means that potential risks may not be fully identified.\n\n**Actionable Steps for Rescue Teams:**\nGiven the limited information, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Re-deploy the drone** to gather more visual data and try to obtain a scene description and key visual details.\n2. **Verify audio file integrity** to resolve the error and obtain a complete audio transcription and risk analysis.\n3. **Proceed with caution**: Rescue teams should exercise caution when approaching the scene, as the lack of information may indicate potential unseen hazards.\n4. **Gather more information**: Consider deploying additional surveillance assets or sending a reconnaissance team to gather more information about the scene and the individual detected.\n5. **Develop a contingency plan**: Be prepared to respond to potential risks or hazards that may be identified as more information becomes available.",
